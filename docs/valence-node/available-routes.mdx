### **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/POST-07BEB8" alt="POST"/> `set_data`**
Sets data in the Redis instance and marks it for pending retrieval in the server. To send data to Bob, we could use the following headers in the `set_data` call:

```json
{
    "address": "76e...dd6",     // Bob's public key address
    "public_key": "a4c...e45",   // Alice's public key
    "signature": "b9f...506"     // Alice's signature of Bob's address, using his public key
}
```

The body of the `set_data` call would contain the data being exchanged:

```json
{
    "data": "hello Bob"
}
```

The headers that Alice sends in her call will be validated by the Valence, after which they'll be stored at Bob's address for his later retrieval using the `get_data` call.

### **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GET-2176FF" alt="GET"/> `get_data`**
Gets pending data from the server for a given address. To retrieve data for Bob, he only has to supply his credentials in the call header:

```json
[
    {
        "address": "76e...dd6",     // Bob's public key address
        "signature": "b9f...506",   // Bob's signature of the public key
        "public_key": "a4c...e45"   // Bob's public key corresponding to his address
    }
]
```

Again, the Valence will validate the signature before returning the data to Bob.

**For best practice, it's recommended that Alice and Bob encrypt their data using their private keys, before exchanging it with each other.** This ensures that the data exchange is E2E encrypted, and that the Valence maintains no knowledge of the data's content.
