# Get Started

Integration wih A-Block can be done simply and easily through the <a href="https://github.com/ABlockOfficial/A-Block.js#a-blockjs">A-Block.js SDK</a>. 
To get started, we can install it to our JavaScript/TypeScript project with `npm`:

<code style={{"display":"inline-block","padding":"10px","marginBottom":"15px"}}>npm install @a-block/a-blockjs</code>

or alternatively with `yarn`:

<code style={{"display":"inline-block","padding":"10px","marginBottom":"15px"}}>yarn add @a-block/a-blockjs</code>

..

## Create A-Block Wallet

Create an instance of an A-Block wallet can be done in two main ways:

1. **initNew**: A new wallet, created from scratch for a new user
2. **initFromSeed**: An existing wallet, generated from a saved seed phrase

..

### Create a New Wallet

You can create a new instance of an A-Block wallet via the SDK's `initNew` method:

```javascript
    import { ABlockWallet } from '@a-block/a-blockjs';

    const COMPUTE_HOST = 'example.compute.host.com';
    const INTERCOM_HOST = 'example.intercom.host.com';
    const PASSPHRASE = 'a secure passphrase';

    // Create the wallet object
    const wallet = new ABlockWallet();

    // Initialize the wallet with the needed configuration
    // NOTE: This is an async call
    wallet
    .initNew({
        computeHost: COMPUTE_HOST,
        intercomHost: INTERCOM_HOST,
        passPhrase: PASSPHRASE,
    })
    .then((initResult) => {
        // Display the seed phrase to the user for safe keeping
        let seedPhrase = initResult.content.initNewResponse[0];
    });
```

This method needs a few parameters to be specified:

- **computeHost**: The IP or domain of the mempool node you want to connect to. You'll need this to make transactions on the network
- **intercomHost**: The IP or domain of an intercom node you want to connect to. You'll need this if you want to make any 2-way transactions with other people/wallets
- **passPhrase**: The passphrase to encrypt your wallet's keypair/s. Make sure this is a super secure value

The `initNew` method is async, so you'll need to use a `.then` or `await` the result in order to get the wallet's seed phrase, for example. 
Once you have a seed phrase, you can always re-initialize the same wallet using that same seed phrase.

..

### Generate an Existing Wallet

If you have an existing seed phrase and want to generate a wallet from it, you can use the `initFromSeed` method:

```javascript
import { ABlockWallet } from '@a-block/a-blockjs';

//... other initialization params

const SEED_PHRASE = 'a seed phrase that should look like a bunch of random words'

// Create the wallet object
const wallet = new ABlockWallet();

// Initialize the wallet with the needed configuration
wallet.initFromSeed({
    computeHost: COMPUTE_HOST,
    intercomHost: INTERCOM_HOST,
    passPhrase: PASSPHRASE,
  },
  seedPhrase: SEED_PHRASE
).then((initResult) => {
  const masterKey = initResult.content.initFromSeedResponse;
});
```

..

## Working with the Wallet

Once initialized, you can access all the functionalities within the wallet. A-Block is a UTXO blockchain, so you 
can generate a new keypair, for example, by using the `getNewKeypair` method:

```javascript
import { ABlockWallet } from '@a-block/a-blockjs';

const wallet = new ABlockWallet();

// ... Initialize the wallet correctly

// The array argument can contain existing keypairs to be used
const newKeypairResult = wallet.getNewKeypair([]);

// Final keypair
const newKeypair: IKeypairEncrypted = newKeypairResult.content.newKeypairResponse;
```

You can then do a number of things with the keypair, for example getting the address associated with that keypair and 
fetching its balance:

```javascript
//... newKeypair initialized

// Get the associated address
const address = newKeypair.address;

// You can now fetch the balance for the address from the chain
const balanceResult = await client.fetchBalance([address]);
const balance = balanceResult.content.fetchBalanceResponse;
```

You can find the rest of the associated functions for your wallet in the SDK's README, but this should give you a good point to 
start from. Next, we'll see how to send and receive payments with the new wallet.
