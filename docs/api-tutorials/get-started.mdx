## Get Started with ABlock API

### Postman Collections

Before diving into the ABlock API, ensure you have the necessary tools. Head to the [**ABlock Postman Collection**](/docs/postman-collections) and download our latest Postman collection. This equips you with all the resources needed to seamlessly integrate ABlock functionalities into your applications.

### Using Postman

To make the most out of ABlock API, start by doing the following steps:

#### **Importing Collections and Environments**

After downloading the Postman collections, import them into your Postman workspace.
Set up the necessary environments to tailor the API interactions to your specific needs.

#### **Making Requests**

Utilize the Postman collections to make requests to various ABlock API endpoints.
Before diving into advanced API operations, it's recommended to run the debug-data route on all three nodes.
This route provides comprehensive information about each node, including the list of accessible endpoints.

### âœ… Verify API Functionality

Before implementing any extensive API operations, use the debug-data route to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Running this route provides comprehensive information about each node, including the list of accessible endpoints.

Example of a ```debug-data``` reponse on **Storage node**:

```json
"node_type": "Storage",
        "node_api": [
            "block_by_num",
            "latest_block",
            "blockchain_entry",
            "debug_data"
        ],
```
