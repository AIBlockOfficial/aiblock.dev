# Storage API



The Storage node is responsible for storing the full blockchain history. 
Once blocks are mined by the miners and sent to the Mempool nodes for validation, they are pushed on to the Storage nodes for long-term storage. 
Anybody is allowed to request a full history of the blockchain from the Storage nodes, but they are not required to keep such a history to participate in the network.
