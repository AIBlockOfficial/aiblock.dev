# Get Started

## Postman collections
Before you start, head to the [**ABlock Postman Collections**](/docs/postman-collections) and download our latest Postman collections. This will give you all the tools you need to start using the ABlock API. 

### Using Postman

#### Importing collection and evironments

#### Making requests

## Using debug-data routes

Before doing anything with the API, the best way to verify that everything works if to run debug-data route on all three nodes. 

This route will return a bunch of information regarding the node. We want to look at the list of all accessible endpoint for that specific node. 

Example of a ```debug-data``` reponse on **Storage node**:
```json
"node_type": "Storage",
        "node_api": [
            "block_by_num",
            "latest_block",
            "blockchain_entry",
            "debug_data"
        ],
```
