UN-COntestable Random Numbers (UNiCORNs) are numbers generated by a group with the property that no member of the group can influence the UNiCORN to produce anything other than a random number. This makes UNiCORNs ideal numbers to seed cryptographic protocols and prove fair (random) selection of elements from an enumerated list.

In the Zenotta blockchain system, UNiCORNs are used for 3 fundamental processes:

- Selecting transactions to be packaged into a block
- Selecting miners for a block round partition
- Selecting the winning miner from the participating miners who submit successful Proof-of-Works within a blocktime

The original [UNiCORN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/366.pdf) paper details its construction and applicability.
