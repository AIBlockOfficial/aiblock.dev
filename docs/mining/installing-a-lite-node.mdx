Lite nodes are the same as mining nodes within the AIBlock system, except that they perform no mining activities. They can also be installed in one of two ways:

1. Docker container
2. Built from source

..

## Docker Container

**⚠️ Running docker on your machine will get you up and running quickly but should not be considered production level. This requires a lot more orchestration that is not in scope of this document.**

Running a mining node through Docker can be done through two main methods:

### Running Docker directly

The Docker image for the user node is available here:

```bash
ghcr.io/aiblockofficial/network/node-user:latest
```

You can run the container from the image directly:

```bash
docker run -d -p --name aiblock-user 3000:3000 \
-v ./user:/src \
-v ./node_settings.toml:/etc/node_settings.toml \
-e ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:12340" \
-e WITH_USER_INDEX="127.0.0.1:12350" \
ghcr.io/aiblockofficial/network/node-user:latest user
```

* `-p 3000:3000` sets ports used for the user's REST API.
* `-v ./user:/src` mounts your local filesystem so the user's wallet may be persisted.
* `-e ADDRESS` sets the ip:port of the node. If more than one node will be running from the same IP address, the port number has to be different for each node. 
* `-e WITH_USER_INDEX` also starts a user node with a wallet to hold the tokens.

You might also need to run with `--user` on some Linux systems for mounting permission purposes.


### Using docker-compose

You can clone `docker-compose.yml` files from the Docker nodes repo at: https://github.com/AIBlockOfficial/DockerNodes. 

From the `DockerNodes` folder you can `cd user-node`, and then run `docker-compose up -d` for detached mode and inspect the logs using `docker-compose logs --follow`. The user node will 
use the `node_settings.toml` in the folder for all the settings that would normally be declared manually in a direct run.

..

## Build from Source

To build a lite node from source, you can implement the following steps:

### Setup

The AIBlock Network runs on Rust, so installing this is the first step before dealing with any code. You can install `rustup`, Rust's toolchain installer, by running the following:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

When asked how to proceed, simply selecting the option `1) Proceed with installation` is generally the best. You can then run the following to update the `PATH` variable and check whether everything installed correctly:

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustc --version
```

If the terminal responds with the `rustc` version you're currently running then everything went well, and you're ready to go. 

### Linux

Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.01 LTS) may require extra package installations depending on what you've developed before. The following package installs assume a completely new machine instance, and should cover everything you need to get going:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install m4
sudo apt-get install llvm
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
```

The above should enable you to install `librocksdb-sys` successfully, but older versions of this crate had bugs so it would be wise to ensure you've installed `rocksdb = "0.21.0"` or higher in order to avoid compilation issues. 

### Lite Node Build

With the prerequisites set up, you can now clone the repo to your local machine:

``` 
git clone git@github.com:AIBlockOfficial/Network.git
```

You can then build everything by running

```rust
cargo build --release
```

This will compile everything into a release state, from which you can then run the following to connect to the Playground testnet to mine:

```
RUST_LOG=warp target/release/node user --config=src/bin/node_settings_playground.toml --api_use_tls=0`
```
