This section covers the recommended hardware requirements for running a mining node on AIBlock

<br/>

### Resource Requirements

The following are the tested hardware specifications for mining nodes within the AIBlock system. These are not necessarily 
the minimum hardware specs required, but mining has been tested on them and runs successfully.
