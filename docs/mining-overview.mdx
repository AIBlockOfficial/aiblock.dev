## Bringing Fairness and Equality Back to Mining

AIBlock has gone to great lengths to ensure that mining on the system is made as fair and equitable as possible. The protocol leverages
a unique consensus mechanism and block creation process to minimise the advantage of ASICs and brings mining back to the CPU. Any CPU.

In addition, AIBlock's use of UNiCORNs in a novel random selection process ensures that the energy used during mining is minimal. AIBlock mining 
is there to validate transactions, rather than consuming vast amounts of electricity.
