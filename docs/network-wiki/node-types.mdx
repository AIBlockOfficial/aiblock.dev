# AI3lock Network Node Types

Unlike Bitcoin's uniform full node miners, the AI3lock Network employs diverse node types to enhance functionality. This diversity ensures quick payment settlements, geographic diversity, lighter blockchain storage requirements, and facilitates token-for-asset payments.

## Types at a Glance

- [**Mempool Node**](Mempool-Node): Collects transactions, bundles them into blocks, and validates mining partitions. *Limited in number*.

- [**Miner Node**](Miner-Node): Similar to Bitcoin miners, responsible for mining new blocks and collecting rewards. *Unlimited in number*.

- [**Storage Node**](Storage-Node): Stores the full blockchain history. Anyone can request it, but not mandatory for network participation. *Limited in number*.

## Why Different Node Types?

### Quick Payment Settlement

Bitcoin recommends a 6-block waiting time for payment validation due to its **past-facing** architecture. AI3lock, in contrast, achieves quick settlement by using Mempool nodes. These nodes coordinate transaction spending and verify ownership immediately, avoiding the need for orphan blocks or lengthy wait times.

### Geographic Diversity

To overcome risks associated with mining concentration in one region, AI3lock places its Mempool nodes in different geographical regions. This prevents any single entity from affecting the network's functioning.

### Lighter Storage Requirements

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, joining AI3lock as a full miner doesn't require downloading the entire blockchain. Storage nodes handle this, allowing potential miners to participate without consuming large amounts of storage.

### Token-For-Asset Payments

AI3lock's 2WT Blockchain records token payments for assets, unlike other blockchains with a **past-facing** architecture. Mempool nodes enable the inclusion of two "half-transactions" from different users in the same block, creating a unique **present-facing** architecture for the AI3lock network.
