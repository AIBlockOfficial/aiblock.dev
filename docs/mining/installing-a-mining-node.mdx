Mining nodes in the AIBlock system can be installed in one of two ways:

1. Docker container
2. Built from source

The Docker container is still currently being built, so for now you'll need to build from source in order to start mining.

## Build from Source

To build a mining node from source, you can implement the following steps:

### Setup

The AIBlock Network runs on Rust, so installing this is the first step before dealing with any code. You can install `rustup`, Rust's toolchain installer, by running the following:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

When asked how to proceed, simply selecting the option `1) Proceed with installation` is generally the best. You can then run the following to update the `PATH` variable and check whether everything installed correctly:

```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustc --version
```

If the terminal responds with the `rustc` version you're currently running then everything went well, and you're ready to go. 

### Linux

Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.01 LTS) may require extra package installations depending on what you've developed before. The following package installs assume a completely new machine instance, and should cover everything you need to get going:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install m4
sudo apt-get install llvm
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
```

The above should enable you to install `librocksdb-sys` successfully, but older versions of this crate had bugs so it would be wise to ensure you've installed `rocksdb = "0.21.0"` or higher in order to avoid compilation issues. 

### Mining Node Build

With the prerequisites set up, you can now clone the repo to your local machine:

``` 
git clone git@github.com:AIBlockOfficial/Network.git
```

You can then build everything by running

```rust
cargo build --release
```

This will compile everything into a release state, from which you can then run the following to connect to the Playground testnet to mine:

```
RUST_LOG=warp target/release/node miner --config=src/bin/node_settings_playground.toml --api_use_tls=0 --with_user_index=0`
```
