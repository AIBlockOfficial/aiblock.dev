Mining nodes can be managed and interacted with through API calls directly. Miners, if started with the `--with_user_index` flag, will provide 
the full range of API endpoints needed to handle tokens and keypairs accrued over the course of mining.

## API Endpoints

### **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GET-2176FF" alt="GET"/> `wallet_info`**

This endpoint will provide full information on the currently running miner, in particular the amount of tokens (and items, if applicable) the miner's 
wallet has accrued.

Example response:

```json
{
    "id": "b06991e6acc945288819aee3df8d40f5",
    "status": "Success",
    "reason": "Wallet info successfully fetched",
    "route": "wallet_info",
    "content": {
        "running_total": 28752801.881904762,
        "item_total": {},
        "addresses": {
            "00b15e53a4d1a33742bce48e4213a89633abeaf87d9116f9e96b83ea7440d122": [
                {
                    "out_point": {
                        "t_hash": "g118ce84fe0f416b43f9af805cc914b0",
                        "n": 0
                    },
                    "value": {
                        "Token": 7488539
                    }
                }
            ],
        }
    }
}
```

..

### **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GET-2176FF" alt="GET"/> `payment_address`**

This endpoint will generate a new address for the miner node to be paid to, including the construction of an associated public/private keypair.

Example response:

```json
{
    "id": "33888339c1f74c5297833d8a87b38984",
    "status": "Success",
    "reason": "New payment address generated",
    "route": "payment_address",
    "content": "ca5314e0cadd38c40f6168e4c8a275a83750dbea1c34d034f024d35f66abc214"
}
```

..

### **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/POST-07BEB8" alt="POST"/> `make_payment`**

This endpoint can be called in order to make a payment from the miner node to an address on the AIBlock network. The body of the request will 
need to conform to the following structure:

```json
{
    "address": "61e7f2a8bdc89d16fb7e9e13a82845a588af71d7ce3d25a27fe526c91393fb6f",
    "amount": 72072000,
    "passphrase": ""
}
```

**NOTE: The `amount` field will be the number of token subunits. The number of subunits in an AIBlock token is 72072000, so if `amount` is 72072000 then you'll be 
making a payment of 1 full token.**

Example response:

```json
{
    "id": "ab6a6f83948548149302d8aa344bb292",
    "status": "Success",
    "reason": "Payment processing",
    "route": "make_payment",
    "content": {
        "61e7f2a8bdc89d16fb7e9e13a82845a588af71d7ce3d25a27fe526c91393fb6f": {
            "asset": {
                "Token": 72072000
            },
            "extra_info": null
        }
    }
}
```
