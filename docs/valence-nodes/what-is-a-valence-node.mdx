# What is a Valence Node?

Valence nodes are a layer 2 solution for massively improving the scaling, throughput and efficiency of the ABlock network. 
They can process transactions, rollups, 2-Way transactions and even mint and facilitate the trade of items. They're also completely 
distributed, which means that anybody can spin a Valence node up and get started, right away.

The core Valence node code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ABlockOfficial/Valence"><b>GitHub here</b></a>, but what really makes 
Valence nodes scale the ABlock network functionality is **plugins**. Plugins extend the functionality of your Valence node and give it new abilities 
to handle specific use cases. Examples of Valence node plugins are:

- <a href="https://github.com/ABlockOfficial/valence_core">Core</a>, which provides reusable functionality for a variety of other Valence node plugins
- <a href="https://github.com/ABlockOfficial/valence_market">Market</a>, which turns your Valence node into a marketplace within seconds

The Valence node code is open source, so you're welcome to contribute with your own plugins, or use plugins built by other members of the ABlock community.
