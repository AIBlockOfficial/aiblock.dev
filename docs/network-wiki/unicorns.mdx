# UNiCORNs

UN-COntestable Random Numbers (UNiCORNs) are numbers generated by a group with the unique property that no member of the group can influence the UNiCORN to produce anything other than a random number. This characteristic makes UNiCORNs ideal for seeding cryptographic protocols and demonstrating fair (random) selection of elements from an enumerated list.

In the ABlock blockchain system, UNiCORNs play a crucial role in three fundamental processes:

- **Selecting transactions to be packaged into a block**
- **Selecting miners for a block round partition**
- **Selecting the winning miner from the participating miners who submit successful Proof-of-Works within a block time**

The original [UNiCORN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/366.pdf) paper provides detailed information about its construction and applicability.
