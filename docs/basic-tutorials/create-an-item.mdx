# Create an Item

After setting up a wallet, you can Create an Item very easily through the A-Block.js SDK. If you're developing 
this in a test environment, you can create 2 new keypairs. We'll use address 1 as our sender (Alice) and address 2 as our receiver (Bob).

```javascript
import { ABlockWallet } from '@a-block/a-blockjs';

const wallet = new ABlockWallet();

// ... Initialize the wallet correctly

// ALICE ADDRESS

const aliceKeypairResult = wallet.getNewKeypair([]);
const aliceKeypair: IKeypairEncrypted = newKeypairResult.content.newKeypairResponse;
const aliceAddress = newKeypair.address;

// BOB ADDRESS

const bobKeypairResult = wallet.getNewKeypair([]);
const bobKeypair: IKeypairEncrypted = newKeypairResult.content.newKeypairResponse;
const bobAddress = newKeypair.address;
```

With these addresses available, we can now Create an Item.

## Sending a Payment

The wallet provides a `makeTokenPayment` method, which simplifies the entire token payment process. This method does all the transaction construction for you, but importantly **it does not check the validity of the payment address**, so 
as the developer you'll need to make sure your application verifies that Bob's address is in fact valid. Otherwise we can make the payment simply:

```javascript
const paymentResult = await wallet.makeTokenPayment({
   bobAddress,      // Address to pay (in this case we want to pay Bob)
   10,              // Payment amount
   [aliceKeypair],  // An array of keypairs to pay from
   aliceKeypair,    // Where the change of your payment should go to
});
```

For this example we're assuming that Alice has `10` tokens to pay Bob. It's also important to note that the `makeTokenPayment` method is async, since it's making a call to the blockchain in order to effect the payment. That means 
you'll need to `await` the result, or handle it asynchronously.

..

## Receiving a Payment

The balance of Bob's address can then be checked on the UTXO, after a sufficient amount of time for the payment to go through on the chain

```javascript
const bobBalanceCall = await wallet.fetchBalance([bobAddress]);
const bobBalance = bobBalanceCall.content.fetchBalanceResponse;
```

The response structure for `bobBalance` will then be something like the following:

```json
{
    "total": {
        "tokens": 10,
        "receipts": {}
    },
    "address_list": {
        "a0b08...c02e5": [
            {
                "out_point": {
                    "t_hash": "g3b13...3353f",
                    "n": 0
                },
                "value": {
                    "Token": 10
                }
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

That's it! A-Block.js has been designed to make sending and receiving payments as quick and easy as possible. Next, we'll take a look at how to make atomic, 2-way payments.
